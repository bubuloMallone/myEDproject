# myEDproject

This repository contains a collection of numerical exact diagonalization (ED) programs developed and used during various research and academic projects.

## Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders, each representing an independent program or analysis module:

- `EDroutine/` – Core ED routine used across different models.
- `Runtime/` – Scripts for specific model simulations and outputs.
- `RuntimeToric/` – Simulation routines for the toric code model.
- `TFIM_ED/` – ED implementation for the transverse-field Ising model.
- `plots/` – Scripts and tools for comparing and visualizing output spectra.
- `compare.py` – A utility to compare results across models.

This structure allows cross-comparison of results while maintaining modularity for each project component.

## Notes

- Some subfolders may use support code developed by collaborators or supervisors. Attribution is included where appropriate.
- Output files and plots are excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to keep the repository lightweight.

## License
